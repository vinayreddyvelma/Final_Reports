    "DICOM is the most popular standard used in medicine for image exchange. The name is derived from **D**igital **I**maging and **CO**mmunication in **M**edicine. It allows to have medical information in the images as a standard file that is independent from the manufacturer. This means that it is possible to have images from MR scanners made by a GE system and display it in a  picture archive system (PACS) from Agfa without any loss or without need of any proprietary information. It also allows opening the image in MATLAB, Python or any language without need to know how GE formatted the image file.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will open here a DICOM image and see some of the information that is stored in the header of the image. You will have for your assignment to retrieve other information from this same image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides some tools for DICOM image opening in the package **PyDICOM**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your installation will likely be missing this package, so you can install it using Anaconda. Open an Anaconda Prompt and type **pip install pydicom**. The version that would likely be installed is pydicom-0.9.9"
